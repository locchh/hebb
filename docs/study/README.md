# Study

## Notes

- [Donald Hebb & Hebbian theory](hebb.md) — the conceptual root: the postulate, cell assemblies, phase sequences, the stability problem, and how it maps onto agent memory.
- [Agent memory tools — comparative study](memory-tools.md) — deep dive on the six memory frameworks with feature / architecture / mechanism tables.
